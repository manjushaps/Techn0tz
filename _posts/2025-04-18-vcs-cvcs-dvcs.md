In the fast-paced world of software development, change is constant. Developers write, rewrite, test, and refine code every day. Without a system to manage those changes, projects would quickly become chaotic. That’s where **Version Control Systems (VCS)** come in.

This post explains the basics of VCS, differences between **Centralized** and **Distributed** systems

## 🧾 What is Version Control System?

A **Version Control System (VCS)** is a tool that helps developers **track changes in code**, **collaborate effectively**, **experiment safely using branches**, and **revert to previous versions** if something goes wrong.

### 🕵️ Imagine you're part of a high-profile investigation...

Every document related to the investigation — updates, evidence, and changes — is crucial and must be recorded in a **master case file**. This file evolves over time and needs to be updated consistently throughout the process.

That’s exactly what a **Version Control System (VCS)** does in software development.

It records detailed notes, timestamps, author information, and every change made — allowing you to go back to any previous version when needed. It also enables **multiple detectives (developers)** to collaborate on the same case without overwriting each other's work.

## 🗂️ Centralized Version Control (CVCS)

In a **Centralized Version Control System**, there is one single **central repository** where all versions of code are stored. Developers connect to this central server to get the latest version of the code or to make updates.

✅ Advantages:
- Simple and easy to set up
- Everyone works on the same central version

⚠️ Disadvantages:
- Requires constant internet connection
- If the central server fails, you lose access to everything

**Examples**: SVN (Subversion), CVS

## 🔄 Decentralized Version Control (DVCS)

In a **Distributed Version Control System**, every developer has a **complete copy of the codebase**, including its full history. This allows for better collaboration, offline access, and safer experimentation.

✅ Advantages:
- Work offline with full project history
- Fast operations (commits,merges)
- No single point of failure

⚠️ Disadvantages:
- More complex branching/merging (initially)

**Examples**: Git, Mercurial
