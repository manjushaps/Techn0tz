<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>What if the most powerful man in the world began his personal journal by thanking the people who shaped his character?</em></strong></p>

  <p>That’s exactly what Marcus Aurelius did in <strong>Book One of Meditations</strong>. Long before offering reflections on self-mastery or fate, he began with gratitude — honoring family, mentors, and teachers who helped form his values.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Marcus Annius Verus</strong> was born in 121 A.D. into a prominent Roman family. Later adopted by Emperor Antoninus Pius, he became <strong>Marcus Aurelius Antoninus</strong>, ruler of Rome from 161 to 180 A.D., and is remembered as one of history’s most respected philosopher-kings.</p>

<p><strong>Meditations</strong> is a collection of his private reflections — written originally in Greek — where he explores character, duty, and inner peace through the lens of Stoic philosophy. This summary is based on the <strong>George Long translation</strong> (public domain), which preserves the clarity and sincerity of Marcus’s thoughts, though in a classical tone.</p>

<p><strong>Book One of Meditations</strong> opens not with philosophical arguments, but with deeply personal expressions of <strong>gratitude</strong> — to those who influenced his moral character. From his grandfather and mother to tutors, friends, and his adoptive father, he reflects on the virtues each person instilled in him.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What follows is a clear and simple summary of Book One — a short but powerful reflection on character, influence, and gratitude.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2 id="-people-who-shaped-marcus---and-what-he-learned">🙏 People Who Shaped Marcus - and What he Learned</h2>
<h3 id="from-my-grandfather-verus">From my grandfather Verus</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>From my grandfather Verus I learned good morals and government of my temper.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marcus thanks his grandfather for teaching him self-restraint and the importance of character — a foundation for the Stoic calm he would later practice.</p>

<h3 id="from-my-father-by-memory">From my father (by memory)</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>From reputation and remembrance of my father, modesty and a manly character.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Though Marcus lost his father, <strong>Annius Verus</strong>, early in life, he remembered him as a man of quiet strength and modesty — a memory that helped shape his own ideal of manhood.</p>

<h3 id="from-my-mother-domitia-calvilla">From my mother Domitia Calvilla</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>From my mother, piety and beneficence, and abstinence not only from evil deeds, but even from evil thoughts.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He praises her for her generosity, simplicity, and inner purity — values that grounded Marcus amid the distractions of public life.</p>

<h3 id="from-my-great-grandfather">From my great-grandfather</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>From my great-grandfather, to avoid the public schools, and to enjoy good teachers at home.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marcus appreciated his great-grandfather’s decision to give him a private, thoughtful education, away from the distractions of public schooling — a foundation for his lifelong learning.</p>

<h3 id="from-my-governor">From my governor</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>From my governor, to be neither of the green nor of the blue at the games…not to meddle with people’s affairs, and not to be ready to listen to slander.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marcus admired his governor’s self-discipline. From him, he learned to avoid distractions, stay neutral in public spectacles, and value hard work over indulgence.</p>

<h3 id="from-my-tutor-rusticus">From my tutor Rusticus</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>From Rusticus, I learned not to be astray to sophistic emulation, nor to writing on speculative matters…..or does benevolent acts in order to make a display.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rusticus reminded Marcus that true philosophy is not for show, but for life. He taught him to look beyond flattery and stay grounded in truth.</p>

<h3 id="from-my-tutor-sextus">From my tutor Sextus</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>From Sextus, a benevolent disposition, and the example of a family governed in a fatherly manner, and the idea of living conformably to nature.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sextus taught Marcus tolerance, calm strength, and the importance of fulfilling public duties with warmth and sincerity. He was a living example of someone who governed both family and self with fatherly care.</p>

<h3 id="from-fronto-my-teacher">From Fronto, my teacher</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>From Fronto I learned to observe what envy, and duplicity, and hypocrisy are in a tyrant, and that generally those among us who are called Patricians are somewhat lacking in parental affection.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marcus learned the art of effective communication and how not to interrupt or correct others in a rude way. Fronto also made him aware of the dangers of pride and the masks powerful people often wear.</p>

<h3 id="from-catulus-my-friend">From Catulus, my friend</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>From Catulus, not to be indifferent when a friend finds fault, even if unjustly, but to try to restore him to his usual disposition; to speak well of teachers, as it is the duty of a father to his children.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Catulus taught him to handle criticism with grace and to speak respectfully of one’s teachers — a lesson in humility and gentleness in relationships.</p>

<h3 id="from-my-brother-severus">From my brother Severus</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>From Severus, love of family, love of truth, and love of justice.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>From Severus, Marcus learned the value of loyalty, truthfulness, and justice — principles that shaped his approach to leadership and helped him maintain steadiness in his Stoic beliefs.</p>

<h3 id="from-my-adoptive-father-antoninus-pius">From my adoptive father Antoninus Pius</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>From my father, I learned gentleness… firmness in purpose… indifference to empty fame… a just temper and a forgiving nature.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marcus deeply admired his adoptive father’s virtues — gentleness, humility, the courage to admit mistakes, and the ability to treat everyone with fairness and warmth, regardless of status. Even after Antoninus’s death, Marcus looked to his memory for guidance, especially in fulfilling his duties as emperor.</p>

<h3 id="to-the-gods">To the gods</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>It is to the gods that I owe having good grandfathers, good parents, a good sister, good teachers, good servants, good kinsmen and friends…</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In his final thanks, Marcus acknowledges the gods for blessing him with good people and a life shaped by virtue. Even with emperor-like power, he bows in humility before fate and fortune — recognizing that much of what made him good was not earned, but given.</p>

<h3 id="from-other-mentors-and-friends">From other mentors and friends</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Diognetus</strong> - Avoid distractions and think independently.</li>
  <li><strong>Apollonius</strong> - Taught the value of liberty and how to remain calm and composed in the face of loss.</li>
  <li><strong>Alexander the grammarian</strong> - Showed patience and kindness; taught that it’s better to lead by example than to reproach others.</li>
  <li><strong>Maximus</strong> - Demonstrated self-governance and how to live with dignity, grace, and joy.</li>
  <li><strong>Alexander the Platonic</strong> - Emphasized that living wisely is more important than merely talking wisely.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h1 id="conclusion-a-life-built-on-gratitude">Conclusion: A Life Built on Gratitude</h1>
<p>Before offering Stoic insights on life and leadership, Marcus Aurelius begins with something quietly powerful: <strong>gratitude</strong>.</p>

<p>In Book One of Meditations, we meet not just an emperor, but a man shaped by others. Each name he mentions is a reminder that character is not built alone — it’s formed through family, mentors, and friends.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>“To have read carefully and not to have been satisfied with a superficial understanding — from Rusticus.”</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marcus doesn’t start with abstract philosophy — he starts with people. These personal notes reveal the heart of Stoicism: <strong>strength shaped by example, and wisdom rooted in humility</strong>.</p>

<p>No matter who we are, we all owe something to those who came before us. Gratitude, Marcus shows us, is not a soft sentiment — it’s where true growth begins.</p>

<p>Welcome to <strong>Part 4 of the Jekyll Series</strong> on <strong>Techn0tz!!</strong>.</p>

<p>In the previous parts, we explored Git, GitHub, installing Jekyll on Windows, building and previewing a site locally, and pushing it to GitHub Pages. Now, it’s time to put that knowledge into practice by creating a real-world project — a fully functional blog named <strong>LiveBlog</strong>, powered by Jekyll and deployed using GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>This step-by-step guide will walk you through everything from creating the site to customizing content, previewing locally, using Git for version control, and deploying it live. By the end, you’ll have your own blog online — and a solid understanding of the full Jekyll workflow.</p>

<h1 id="-project-overview">📄 Project Overview</h1>
<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>
<p>To build a working static blog using <strong>Jekyll(with the Minima theme)</strong> and deploy it publicly using GitHub Pages. We will build and customize a new site called <strong>LiveBlog</strong>, track its changes using Git, and publish it to the web — for free.</p>

<h1 id="-steps-to-build-jekyll-site-locally">📝 Steps to Build Jekyll Site Locally</h1>
<h2 id="-step-1-initialize-your-jekyll-site">🌐 Step 1: Initialize Your Jekyll Site</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll new myblog</code></strong> -  This command creates a new Jekyll site with all necessary files and folders pre-configured.
    <ul>
      <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll new</code></strong> - creates a new Jekyll site.</li>
      <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">myblog</code></strong> - name of your site folder. You can replace <strong>myblog</strong> with any folder name.</li>

  <p><strong>Note</strong>: This post uses the default Jekyll site setup without any custom themes or configurations. The default site already includes an example post <strong>(2025-05-12-welcome-to-jekyll.md)</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="-step-2-navigate-to-the-directory">🌐 Step 2: Navigate to the Directory</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd myblog</code></strong> to enter the newly created site directory.
    <ul>
      <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code></strong> stands for change directory, this command moves to newly created folder <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">myblog</code></strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tip: Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -R</code> command to view the complete jekyll folder structure</strong>.</p>

<img src="/Techn0tz/assets/images/tree_struct.png" alt="folders" width="600" height="auto" /></li>
</ul>

<p>The directory structure is:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>_config.yml</em></strong> - Main configuration file for your Jekyll site.</li>
  <li><strong><em>_posts/</em></strong> - Directory for your blog posts (Markdown files).</li>
  <li><strong><em>Gemfile</em></strong> -  Lists dependencies (gems) for your site.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Gemfile.lock</em></strong> -  Auto-generated by Bundler (dependency lock).</li>
  <li><strong><em>404.html</em></strong> - Default “Page not found” template.</li>
  <li><strong><em>about.markdown</em></strong> - Example “About Page”.</li>
  <li><strong><em>index.markdown</em></strong> - Homepage of your site.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-step-3-install-dependencies">🌐 Step 3: Install Dependencies</h2>
<ul>
  <li>After navigating to your Jekyll site directory, install all the dependencies using <strong>Bundler</strong>.
    <ul>
      <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle install</code></strong> - This command automatically reads the <strong>GemFile</strong> and install all the required plugins and supporting libraries for your Jekyll site.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Screenshot</em> - Running <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle intall</code></strong> command in Git Bash
<img src="/Techn0tz/assets/images/bundle_install.png" alt="bundle" width="600" height="auto" /></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-step-4-build-and-serve-jekyll-site-locally">🌐 Step 4: Build and Serve Jekyll Site Locally</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Now all the dependencies are installed locally, the next step is to build and preview your Jekyll site locally on your system.
    <ul>
      <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle exec jekyll serve</code></strong> - This command builds the site using the correct version of Jekyll specified for your Gemfile and starts a local development server <strong>(http://localhost:4000)</strong> by default.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Screenshot</em> - Running <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle exec jekyll serve</code></strong> command in Git Bash

</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="-understanding-how-changes-work">🧭 Understanding How Changes Work</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Now that your Jekyll site is up and running, let’s see how it responds to changes. Jekyll automatically rebuilds the site when files are changed.</li>
  <li><strong>Example: Modify the index.md file (change the title, as shown in the screenshot below).</strong></li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Screenshot</em> - Editing index.md file
<img src="/Techn0tz/assets/images/change_md.png" alt="md update" width="600" height="auto" /></p>
  </li>

</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="-understanding-markdown-files-and-jekyll-_posts-directory">💡 Understanding Markdown files and Jekyll _posts Directory</h2>
<ul>
  <li>With your site running, it’s time to learn how to create content. Jekyll uses <strong>Markdown (.md)</strong> files to create and format blog posts.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Markdown (.md)</strong> is a light-weight markup language that uses simple symbols to format text.</li>
      <li>Jekyll use Markdown files to create and format blog posts.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  # Heading 1
  ## Heading 2
  - Bullet list item
  **Bold Text**
  [Link Text](https://example.com)
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-jekylls-_posts-directory">📁 Jekyll’s _posts Directory</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This directory stores all your blog posts.</li>
  <li><strong>Naming convention:  YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md (eg. 2025-05-12-welcome-to-jekyll.md)</strong>.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Each post must begin with <strong>Front Matter (YAML format)</strong>, which provides essential details about the post.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Example for Front Matter:</strong>
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>layout: post
title: "My First Blog Post"
date: 2025-05-10 
categories: Git
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>layout</strong>: post specifies that this is a blog post.</li>
  <li>The <strong>title, date, and categories</strong> fields describe your post.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="️-creating-your-first-blog-post-using-vs-code">‼️ Creating Your First Blog Post using VS Code</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Open the _posts directory in <strong>VS Code</strong> (or your preferred text editor).</li>
  <li>Create a new <strong>.md</strong> file with the format: <strong>YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md</strong>.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>To ensure a clean and reproducible setup process, I used <strong>Windows Sandbox</strong> — a secure, disposable virtual environment available in Windows 10/11 Pro—for testing and capturing screenshots during installation.</p>

  <p>This allowed me to document each step from a fresh state without interfering with my main system.</p>

  <p>However, you can follow all the steps below directly on your regular Windows system. Using Windows Sandbox is completely optional and only used here for demonstration purposes.</p>

<p>Before diving into branching, it’s important to understand how Git stores your project.
Unlike some older version control systems, Git doesn’t store data as a series of changesets or differences. Instead, it stores your project as a series of snapshots.</p>

<p>Each time you commit, Git captures the full state of your project — like taking a photo of all your files at that moment.</p>

<p>But a commit does more than just save a message. It also records the complete snapshot, links to its parent commit, and silently builds the structure that makes branching possible.</p>

<p>This creates a chain — each commit pointing to the one before it — forming a structure called a <strong>Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)</strong>.</p>

<p>For example.. <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[C0]&lt;--[C1]&lt;--[C2]....</code></strong> (C - commits, C0 is the initial commit, C1 is the next and so on)</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="commit-internals">📌Commit internals</h1>
<p>With that foundation, it’s time to explore what actually makes up a Git commit.</p>

<p>Behind every commit is a compact data structure that stores your project’s snapshot, tracks changes over time, and links everything together. Understanding this internal structure helps you see how branching — and Git’s powerful history tracking — works under the hood.</p>

<p>When you run <strong>git commit</strong>, Git creates a commit object that includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>A pointer to a tree</em> - The tree object represents the snapshot of your project directory.It also maps file names to blobs (file contents) and subfolders to other trees.</li>
  <li><em>Parent commit</em> - The parent commit is just a pointer (a SHA-1 hash) to the previous commit(s).Each commit (except the first) points back to at least one parent and a merge commit has multiple parents.</li>
  <li><em>Metadata</em> - Author name, email, timestamp and committer info (can be different)</li>
  <li><em>Commit message</em> - The message  for the commit given in <strong>git commit -M message</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>For example if you commit three files, the Git repository contains five objects:</em></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Three Blobs:</strong> These blobs represent the contents of each file.</li>
  <li><strong>One tree:</strong> This tree object holds the folder structure and file names.</li>
  <li><strong>One commit:</strong> The commit object points to the tree and stores metadata like the author, commit message, and timestamp.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/Techn0tz/assets/images/commit_internals.png" alt="commit_internals" width="500" height="auto" /></p>

<h2 id="-subsequent-commit-with-changes">🔃 Subsequent Commit with Changes</h2>

<p>When you modify one of the files and commit again, Git handles the changes efficiently:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>New Blob for the modified file:</em> A new blob is created for the modified file, containing only the changes.</li>
  <li><em>Reused Blobs for unchanged files:</em> Git reuses the blobs for the files that haven’t been modified, saving space and processing time.</li>
  <li><em>New Tree:</em> A new tree object is created that points to the correct mix of old and new blobs. This ensures the updated file structure reflects the changes.</li>
  <li><em>New Commit Object:</em> A new commit object is created, pointing to the new tree. It also points to the previous commit as its parent, preserving the commit history.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="️-branching-and-the-role-of-head">🗒️ Branching and the Role of HEAD</h2>
<p>The <strong>main branch (and HEAD)</strong> points to the latest commit, effectively continuing the chain of commits. This structure — consisting of snapshots (blobs), directories (trees), and commit objects — is what makes Git branching so fast and powerful. Each new commit doesn’t duplicate data but rather builds upon the existing objects, making the entire process efficient and scalable.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="-git-branching-and-merging">🔗 Git Branching and Merging</h1>
<p>Git branching is a powerful feature that allows you to develop features, fix bugs, or experiment with new ideas in isolation — without affecting the main codebase.</p>

<p>A <strong>branch in Git</strong> is essentially a lightweight pointer to a specific commit. When you create a new branch, you’re starting a separate line of development, allowing you to make changes independently of the default branch (often called main or master).</p>

<p>Each time you commit on a branch, the branch pointer (e.g., main or feature-xyz) automatically advances to point to the latest commit. This way, Git tracks the evolution of that branch as development continues.</p>

<p><strong>Merging in Git</strong> combines the changes from one branch (like feature) into another (like main) by creating a merge commit that links the histories of both branches.</p>

<p>The diagram below illustrates how Git handles branching and merging, starting from a common base commit and progressing through independent development on a feature branch:</p>

<p><img src="/Techn0tz/assets/images/Git_branching_eg.png" alt="Branching_eg" width="500" height="auto" /></p>

<p>In the last post, we explored Version Control System and their types — CVCS and DVCS. Now, let’s zoom into the most popular DVCS tool in the world: <strong>Git</strong> — and see how it powers modern development.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="-what-is-git">📜 What is Git?</h1>

<p>Git is open source Distributed Version Control Sytem which allows developers</p>
<ul>
  <li>Track changes in code over time</li>
  <li>Collaborate seamlessly with teammates</li>
  <li>Create branches for experimental study</li>
  <li>Roll back to previous versions when things goes wrong</li>
</ul>

  <p>⌛Think of Git as your <strong>projects time machine</strong> - but smarter, faster and made for team work</p>

<h1 id="-core-components-git-and-lvc-worflow">🎯 Core Components Git and LVC worflow</h1>

<p>The Git workflow is a step-by-step process that defines how changes in a project move from your local machine to a shared, remote repository like GitHub. Mastering this flow helps you collaborate smoothly and  manage versions efficiently.</p>

<p><strong>This post explains about Git basics and how the files are committed locally</strong></p>

<p>The core components of LVC worflow are: <strong>Working Directory, Staging Area, Local Repository</strong>. Understanding how files move through these stages are essential.</p>

<p><img src="/Techn0tz/assets/images/LVC_workflow.png" alt="LVC Workflow" width="500" height="auto" /></p>

<p>The diagram above outlines the LVC process. Now, let’s explore each stage and see how your local project files eventually become committed, shared history.</p>

<h2 id="-working-directory">📂 Working Directory</h2>

<p>This is the local folder on your computer where you edit and work on your project files</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git init</code></strong> command - Intializes a Git repository
    <ul>
      <li>The Git starts tracking the specified folder as a Git project- in other words, your plain folder(working directory) is converted into .Git project</li>
      <li>Creates a hidden <strong>.git.</strong> folder in the working directory</li>
      <li>This .git/  folder contains everything that Git needs to track your project (eg. commit, branch, logs etc)</li>
      <li>Your <strong>working directory stays the same</strong>, but now Git is watching for changes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="️-staging-area">🗃️ Staging Area</h2>

<p>The staging area (index) is like a holding zone- where Git gathers all the changes that you want to commit</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add</code></strong> command - moves the changes from working directory to the staging area
    <ul>
      <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add filename</code></strong> - Adds a specific file to the staging area</li>
      <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add .</code></strong> - Adds all the modified files in the folder</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-local-repository">📁 Local Repository</h2>

<p>The local repository is the <strong>.git directory</strong>- which is the Git’s repository storage</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit</code> command - the changes from the staging area are permanently stored in the repository
    <ul>
      <li>The repository is located inside the hidden <strong>.git/</strong> folder- the one created by <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git init</code></strong></li>
      <li>The .git directory contains all the commits, project history, branches, logs etc</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The snapshot below provides a practical example of how to create a new directory, initialize a Git repository, and set up local version control. It will walk you through the essential steps, including adding files to the staging area, committing changes, and managing version history on your local machine. By following along, you’ll gain hands-on experience in using Git for efficient source code management.</p>

<h2 id="-technuggetz---did-you-know">🧠 TechNuggetz - Did you Know?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>⌛ <strong>Git</strong> was built by <strong>Linus Torvalds - Founder of Linus</strong> in just 2 weeks in 2005 - Iconic!</p>

  <p>☑️ <strong>Git</strong> knows everything locally, it dosen’t need internet to track changes - from version history, staging and committing - everithing happens in your local machine.</p>

  <p>❌ Made a mistake? <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git checkout -- filename</code></strong> - restores a file to its last committed state</p>

  <p>🗂️ Track only what matters! Use a <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitignore</code></strong> file to prevent sensitive data (like passwords, logs, or config files) from slipping into your commits. A cleaner repo is a safer repo!</p>

  <p>🪄 Autosave magic! Use <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git stash</code></strong> to save your work-in-progress without a commit. Come back later with <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git stash pop</code></strong> and pick up right where you left off!</p>

<h1 id="️-remote-repository">🗺️ Remote Repository</h1>
<h2 id="-connecting-your-local-repository-to-github">🔄 Connecting Your Local Repository to GitHub</h2>
<p>Once you’ve committed your changes locally, the next step is to upload (push) your code to GitHub so it’s safely stored online and ready to share or collaborate</p>

<h2 id="-creating-a-new-repository-on-github">🆕 Creating a new repository on GitHub</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Go to <strong>https://github.com</strong></li>
  <li>Click on ➕ New repository</li>
  <li>Fill in:
    <ul>
      <li>Repository name (e.g., my-demo-project)</li>
      <li>Choose Public or Private</li>
      <li>DO NOT check “Initialize this repository with a README” (since you already have local files)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click Create repository</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-link-repo-to-github-and-pushing-to-remote-repository">💻 Link Repo to GitHub and pushing to remote repository</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Before pushing to GitHub, use <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git branch -M main</code></strong> command - to rename Git’s default branch <strong>master to main</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Git defaults to master, but GitHub uses main, so renaming it helps avoid conflicts when pushing to GitHub.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/my-demo-project.git</code></strong> command- Git adds a new connection to the remote repo
    <ul>
      <li><em>Replace URL with your actual repository URL</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git push -u origin main</code></strong> command - the changes that are committed locally are sent to the <em>main branch</em> of your GiHub’s repository
    <ul>
      <li>-u or –set upstream is used only for initial push</li>
      <li>Next time when you want to push to same branch just use <em>git push</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>🥇<strong>Now your code is live on GitHub! You can visit your repository URL to confirm</strong></p>

<h1 id="-conclusion">📃 Conclusion</h1>

<p>Understanding the Git workflow — from your working directory to the remote repository — is the foundation of effective version control.In this post we saw  how files move through Local version control to online using real commands, visuals, and hands-on examples.
Whether you’re working solo or collaborating with others, mastering these Git basics will help you track changes, avoid mistakes, and push your projects confidently to GitHub</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="-technuggetz---did-you-know">💡 TechNuggetz - Did you Know?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>📇 GitHub isn’t a centralized VCS — it’s a remote platform where teams collaborate using Git. The version control stays distributed, even when using GitHub.</p>

  <p>⭐ The name GitHub comes from <strong>Git</strong> (the version control tool) + <strong>Hub</strong> (a central place where developers collaborate). It’s literally a hub for Git repositories!</p>

  <p>💭 Always run <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git pull</code></strong> before <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git push</code></strong> to avoid merge surprises when working in teams!</p>

Developers write, rewrite, test, and refine code every day. Without a system to manage those changes, projects would quickly become chaotic. That’s where <strong>Version Control Systems (VCS)</strong> come in.</p>

<p>This post explains the basics of VCS, differences between <strong>Centralized</strong> and <strong>Distributed</strong> systems</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="-what-is-version-control-system">🧾 What is Version Control System?</h1>

<p>A <strong>Version Control System (VCS)</strong> is a tool that helps developers <strong>track changes in code</strong>, <strong>collaborate effectively</strong>, <strong>experiment safely using branches</strong>, and <strong>revert to previous versions</strong> if something goes wrong.</p>

<h2 id="️-imagine-youre-part-of-a-high-profile-investigation">🕵️ Imagine you’re part of a high-profile investigation…</h2>

<p>Every document related to the investigation — updates, evidence, and changes — is crucial and must be recorded in a <strong>master case file</strong>. This file evolves over time and needs to be updated consistently throughout the process.</p>

<p>That’s exactly what a <strong>Version Control System (VCS)</strong> does in software development.</p>

<p>It records detailed notes, timestamps, author information, and every change made — allowing you to go back to any previous version when needed. It also enables <strong>multiple detectives (developers)</strong> to collaborate on the same case without overwriting each other’s work.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="️-centralized-version-control-cvcs">🗂️ Centralized Version Control (CVCS)</h1>

<p>In a <strong>Centralized Version Control System</strong>, there is one single <strong>central repository</strong> where all versions of code are stored. Developers connect to this central server to get the latest version of the code or to make updates.</p>

<p>✅ Advantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Simple and easy to set up</li>
  <li>Everyone works on the same central version</li>
</ul>

<p>⚠️ Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Requires constant internet connection</li>
  <li>If the central server fails, you lose access to everything</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Examples</strong>: SVN (Subversion), CVS</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="-decentralized-version-control-dvcs">🔄 Decentralized Version Control (DVCS)</h1>

<p>In a <strong>Distributed Version Control System</strong>, every developer has a <strong>complete copy of the codebase</strong>, including its full history. This allows for better collaboration, offline access, and safer experimentation.</p>

<p>✅ Advantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Work offline with full project history</li>
  <li>Fast operations (commits,merges)</li>
  <li>No single point of failure</li>
</ul>

<p>⚠️ Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>More complex branching/merging (initially)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Examples</strong>: Git, Mercurial</p>
