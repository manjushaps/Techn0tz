Developers write, rewrite, test, and refine code every day. Without a system to manage those changes, projects would quickly become chaotic. That’s where <strong>Version Control Systems (VCS)</strong> come in.</p>

<p>This post explains the basics of VCS, differences between <strong>Centralized</strong> and <strong>Distributed</strong> systems</p>

<h2 id="-what-is-version-control-system">🧾 What is Version Control System?</h2>

<p>A <strong>Version Control System (VCS)</strong> is a tool that helps developers <strong>track changes in code</strong>, <strong>collaborate effectively</strong>, <strong>experiment safely using branches</strong>, and <strong>revert to previous versions</strong> if something goes wrong.</p>

<h3 id="️-imagine-youre-part-of-a-high-profile-investigation">🕵️ Imagine you’re part of a high-profile investigation…</h3>

<p>Every document related to the investigation — updates, evidence, and changes — is crucial and must be recorded in a <strong>master case file</strong>. This file evolves over time and needs to be updated consistently throughout the process.</p>

<p>That’s exactly what a <strong>Version Control System (VCS)</strong> does in software development.</p>

<p>It records detailed notes, timestamps, author information, and every change made — allowing you to go back to any previous version when needed. It also enables <strong>multiple detectives (developers)</strong> to collaborate on the same case without overwriting each other’s work.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="️-centralized-version-control-cvcs">🗂️ Centralized Version Control (CVCS)</h2>

<p>In a <strong>Centralized Version Control System</strong>, there is one single <strong>central repository</strong> where all versions of code are stored. Developers connect to this central server to get the latest version of the code or to make updates.</p>

<p>✅ Advantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Simple and easy to set up</li>
  <li>Everyone works on the same central version</li>
</ul>

<p>⚠️ Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Requires constant internet connection</li>
  <li>If the central server fails, you lose access to everything</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Examples</strong>: SVN (Subversion), CVS</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-decentralized-version-control-dvcs">🔄 Decentralized Version Control (DVCS)</h2>

<p>In a <strong>Distributed Version Control System</strong>, every developer has a <strong>complete copy of the codebase</strong>, including its full history. This allows for better collaboration, offline access, and safer experimentation.</p>

<p>✅ Advantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Work offline with full project history</li>
  <li>Fast operations (commits,merges)</li>
  <li>No single point of failure</li>
</ul>

<p>⚠️ Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>More complex branching/merging (initially)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Examples</strong>: Git, Mercurial</p>

  <p>🧠 <strong><em>Version Control</em></strong> dates back to the 1970s — with <strong>RCS</strong> and <strong>SCCS</strong>!</p>

  <p>☁️ In the <strong><em>Centralized Version Control</em></strong>, the server is the boss - if it goes down, no server, no service! <em>Time for a coffee!</em>☕</p>

  <p>🌏 <strong>Distributed VCS</strong> like Git gives each developer a full copy of the repository — work offline, experiment freely, and break stuff without fear!</p>
